##Odot: Backbone.js CRUD To Do Application

This repo contains my initial solution to an assessment challenge which prompted the creation of a simple to do list application using Backbone.js.

This is my second iteration of this project (first iteration used jQuery to test Node routes on client side).

My next step is to refactor this into Marionette.js and use PostgreSQL.

Check out the app on [heroku](https://odot-todo.herokuapp.com/).
